# Determine how to locate different types of files in Magento.

>One of the first things you can do to get started with component development is to understand and set up the file system. Each type of component has a different file structure, although all components require certain files.
In addition, you can choose the component root directory to start development. The following sections have more information. - [Magento DevDocs - About component file structure](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/prepare/prepare_file-str.html)

### Where are the files containing JavaScript, HTML, and PHP located?
- view/frontend/web/js
- view/frontend/requirejs-config.js
- view/frontend/layout
- view/frontend/templates

### Root directory location

>A component’s root directory is the top-level directory for that component under which its folders and files are located. Depending on how your Magento development environment was installed, your component’s root directory can be located in two places: - [Magento DevDocs - Create your component file structure](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/extension-dev-guide/build/module-file-structure.html)

##### `<Magento install directory>/app:` 
* Modules - app/code.
* Storefront themes - app/design/frontend.
* Admin themes - app/design/adminhtml.
* Language packages - use app/i18n.

##### `<Magento install directory>/vendor`

>This location is found in the alternative setups where the composer create-project command was used to get a Magento 2 metapackage (which downloads the CE or EE code), or a compressed Magento 2 archive was extracted in order to install Magento.
>
>Any third party components (and the Magento application itself) are downloaded and stored under the vendor directory. If you are using Git to manage project, this directory is typically added to the .gitignore file. Therefore, we recommend you do your customization work in app/code, not vendor.

### Required files

>`registration.php`: Among other things, this file specifies the directory in which the component is installed by vendors in production environments. By default, composer automatically installs components in the <Magento root dir>/vendor directory. For more information, see Component registration.
>
>`etc/module.xml`: This file specifies basic information about the component such as the components dependencies and its version number. This version number is used to determine schema and data updates when bin/magento setup:upgrade is run.
>
>`composer.json`: Specifies component dependencies and other metadata. For more information, see Composer integration.

### Common directories

>`Block` - contains PHP view classes as part of Model View Controller(MVC) vertical implementation of module logic.
>
>`Controller` - contains PHP controller classes as part of MVC vertical implementation of module logic.
>
>`etc` - contains configuration files; in particular, module.xml, which is required.
>
>`Model` - contains PHP model classes as part of MVC vertical implementation of module logic.
>
>`Setup` -  contains classes for module database structure and data setup which are invoked when installing or upgrading.

### Additional directories

>`Api` - contains any PHP classes exposed to the API.
>
>`i18n` - contains localization files.
>
>`Plugin` - contains any needed plug-ins.
>
>`view` - contains view files, including static view files, design templates, email templates, and layout files.
